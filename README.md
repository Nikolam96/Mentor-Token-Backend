The Mentor Token project is designed to connect small businesses and startups with experienced mentors who can offer valuable advice and leadership in areas such as finance, business growth, and management. The goal is to facilitate meaningful connections and provide tailored guidance to help businesses thrive.

For this project, I used Node.js with Express for the backend, and employed MongoDB as the database with Mongoose as the ORM to manage data efficiently. I developed collections for users, job postings, and ratings.

I implemented authentication and authorization with JWT tokens to ensure secure and reliable user access. This included designing a user registration and login system with token-based security. The project also features a dynamic front end, which enhances the user experience and provides a seamless interface for interacting with the platform.

This project not only demonstrates my technical skills but also reflects my ability to design and build full-stack applications that address real-world needs. It showcases my proficiency in integrating multiple technologies and creating a consistent solution.
